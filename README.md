Resume Parser
Industry Type: Human Resources/Recruitment

**Project Title:** 

Resume Parsing

**Problem Statement/Opportunity:**

The manual process of parsing resumes and extracting relevant information for recruitment purposes is time-consuming and prone to errors. There is a need for an automated solution that can accurately parse resumes of various formats, extract key attributes such as roles, skills, period, education, companies, name, email, and phone number, and generate a concise synopsis of the candidate's profile. This will help recruiters in the IT industry to efficiently search and evaluate potential candidates.

**Project Description:**

The project aims to develop an automated resume parsing and candidate profile synthesis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Azure services. The key features of the project include:

1. Resume Format Conversion:
Implement a module to handle different resume formats such as .docx, .doc, .pdf, .txt, etc. Use Azure Cognitive Services (such as Azure Form Recognizer) to extract text content from these files.

2. Information Extraction:
Utilize NLP techniques, including Named Entity Recognition (NER) and rule-based approaches, to extract relevant attributes from the parsed text. Use Azure Cognitive Services like Azure Text Analytics or Azure Natural Language Understanding for NER tasks.

3. Database Storage:
Design a database schema to store the extracted information. Use Azure Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database service, for efficient storage and querying of candidate data.

Key Benefits:

- Efficiency: Automating the resume parsing process saves time and reduces manual errors.

- Accuracy: NLP techniques improve the accuracy of information extraction.

- Search and Evaluation: Recruiters can quickly search and evaluate potential candidates based on extracted attributes.
